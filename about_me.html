			<p class="main_description">
				Over the years, I have lived in 3 states. I finally settled in Oklahoma about a decade ago, where I began many of my interests.
				I had always been fond of technology and video games. Though, in my Junior year of HS did I spark an interest towards
				how the technology worked. From there, I was able to meet many wonderful people to further grow my knowledge and
				interest in the IT field.
				
				<br><br><br>

				Right out of HS, I took on a degree in IT. Grabbed a job with an IT support company. While there, picked up my interest
				in photography. I was able to loan my first personal car, in comes Cali as well as my interest in cars and the car 
				community. From there, I have been able to collect the memories and adventures that I have come across in just the past
				couple years. 

				<br><br><br>

				I know I have only scratched the surface for many of these interests, and I am excited to see where it all takes me. I am eager to 
				meet the people these interests will bring me to. I plan to take this adventure on, and will proceed to better each skill to help
				myself, as we as those I meet along the way.
